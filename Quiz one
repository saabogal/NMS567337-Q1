# 1.0 (Standard normal distribution)
#Determine the quantiles
q1 = qnorm(0.25)
q2 = qnorm(0.75)

# Set the value of the interquantile range and the SD
niqr = IQR = q2 - q1
nsd  = 1

# Set the proportion of SD to IQR
pnor = niqr/nsd
# The relationship is given by 1.3489 SD per IQR or 0.7413 IQR per SD

# 2.0 (Binomial distribution) 
#Set a group of random variables under a binomial distribution 
Y = rbinom(40, 10000, 0.5)

# let us take a look at the density of the given random sample
d = density(Y)
plot(d)

# Compute the values of the IQR and the SD
bsd  = sd(Y)
biqr = IQR(Y, type = 7)

# Set the proportion of SD to IQR
bip = biqr/bsd
# Thus the relationship for the given distribution is of 1.250797 SD to
# 1 IQR or 0.799490245 IQR to SD


# 3.0 (Cauchy distribution) Set a group of random variables under Cauchy
# distribution
c = rcauchy(50)

# let us take a look at the density of the given random sample
cd = density(c)
plot(cd)

# Compute the values of the IQR
csd  = sd(c)
ciqr = IQR(c, type = 7)

# Set the proportion of SD to IQR
cip = ciqr/csd
cip
# Thus the relationship for the given distribution is of 0.2143317 SD to 1 IQR
# or 4.665665415 IQR to SD

# 4.0 (Exponential distribution) Set a group of random variables under
# Cauchy distribution
e = rexp(10000)

# let us take a look at the density of the given random sample
ed = density(e)
plot(ed)

# Compute the values of the IQR
esd  = sd(e)
eiqr = IQR(e, type = 7)

# Set the proportion of SD to IQR
eip = eiqr/esd
eip
# Thus the relationship for the given distribution is of 1.066405 SD to 1 IQR
# or .993403305 IQR to SD
